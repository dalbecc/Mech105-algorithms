# LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting Script
---
* This MATLAB script performs LU factorization of a given matrix, which decomposes it into a lower triangular matrix, an upper triangular matrix and a pivot matrix. This factorization is useful in solving systems of linear equations; using Gauss elimination with partial pivoting to generate the three matrices.
